# Layers
Layers is a library for Neural Networks in TensorFlow. It provides implementations for a variety of neural network layers and other helper functions in TensorFlow. It is designed with an emphasis on being well documented, cleanly written, and as generalizable as possible to new network architectures. To this end, many tricks and techniques are used to ensure the best-practice methods of defining these layers are used by default.
